Problem:

Multiply the array for every item except the value of location i itself.

Thought:

This is very similar to the fibonacci solution and I was able to wrap my logic around what was needed, but trouble was confusing reading the data.

Data was confusing because bad variable wording. Lessons to learn :)

As for the problem itself, I earlier on realized its a sliding box problem where we have to do a mulitplier left to right and right to left.

Once done, multiply the necessary possitions in the array.

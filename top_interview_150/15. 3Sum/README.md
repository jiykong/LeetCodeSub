Description:
    Get the necessary tuple that will add up to 0

Thought:
    This problem is different than previous problems so its trickier.

Solution:
    Overthought this and later realized that the problem will require quadratic formula.
    
    Intially attempted linear solution but read the hints and realized that is impossible.

    Opted for a quadratic solution but check if the tuple exist in the solutions array was causing time exceeding error.

    Looked at a solution and found one where individual was scanning through while the values were the same which prevented
    duplicate trips getting appended into solutions array.

Verdict:
    I'm realizing sometimes that its impossible to go down to linear solution and accept the quads.

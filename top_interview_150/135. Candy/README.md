Problem

Every child gets a candy but make sure a child with higher rating gets 1 more candy than the ones sitting next to them in the array.

Thought,

Forward/Backward problem.

Use an array and assign it values of 1. Compare/contrast the values from 0 - end and then end - 0. This will properly stack the array with appropriate candy #

PROBLEM: Thought if ratings were equal then everyone they will get same candy and create a trapizoid. Found out that this is not the case...

End result:

REALLY EASY.

Problem:
Rotate the array by k steps

NOTE: edit the array in line

Solution seems simple as the main requirement is to extract the last k items in the array and switch.

Realized that there is also a base condition requirement as rotating more than len(num) means list stays the same.

I thought this was fairly easy.

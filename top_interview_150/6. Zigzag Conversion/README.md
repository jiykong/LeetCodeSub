Problem

Take a string and zig zag it

Thought:
This was more of a math organizational problem rather than a algo problem.

I had hard time wrapping my head around some syntaxes and also how to mathematically organize the solution.

I understood what I had to do but hard a hard time finding the proper formula.

Luckily found the solution but was not able to get the optimal solution

There is a faster way that won't require a 2nd for loop but I opted to bruteforce

Problem:
find the first occurence of a string inside a string and return the starting index of the substring

Solution:

Easy Python.
Split the string based on the substring.

If return size of the array is 1 then there was no match and return -1

else:

    return the size of the first item in the array since it is all of the characters before the split.
